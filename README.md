# 📊 Descriptive Statistics Wine Quality

## 📝 Description
This Jupyter Notebook contains an exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics implementation using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. The main focus is to understand, calculate, and visualize key statistical measures including:
- Mean, Median, and Mode
- Variance and Standard Deviation
- Skewness and Kurtosis
- Data distribution visualizations 


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the concepts of descriptive statistics through practical examples.
- Improve data exploration skills using Python.
- Enhance the ability to interpret data distributions through visualizations.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab ready.
2. Install the required libraries:
3. Open the file `Descriptive_Statistics_Assignment_Day_8.ipynb`.
4. Run the cells from top to bottom to follow the analysis flow.

## 📁 Dataset
The analysis in this notebook uses the `winequality-red.csv` dataset, which contains physicochemical and quality-related data of red wine samples. Make sure the CSV file is placed in the same directory as the notebook before running.
